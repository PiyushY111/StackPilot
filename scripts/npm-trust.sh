# Switches npm publishing from a token to trusted publishing (OIDC), once, after the first release
# (RELEASING.md). npm can only trust a workflow for a package that already exists, which is why the
# very first release publishes with a short-lived token.

#   sh scripts/npm-trust.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Afterwards only .github/workflows/release.yml, running in the `release` environment of this repo,
# can publish. Then delete the NPM_TOKEN secret and the token itself, and on npmjs.com set each
# package to "Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens".
