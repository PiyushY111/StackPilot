# Contributing to StackPilot

Thanks for helping. StackPilot is a terminal system monitor and process manager for macOS and Linux.
This guide covers what you need to work on it and what a change needs before it can be merged.

## Ground rules

- Be kind: this project follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Security problems go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), never a public issue.
- For anything larger than a bug fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach. The design
  documents ([PRD](docs/PRD.md), [BUILD_PLAN](docs/BUILD_PLAN.md), [UI_SPEC](docs/UI_SPEC.md)) describe
  how the product is meant to behave. A change that disagrees with them should update them too.

## Setup

| Tool | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [Bun](https://bun.sh) | 1.4 (`packageManager` in package.json) | Runs the UI, the Bun test suites and the binary build |
| Node.js | ≥ 20 | The core must also run under Node; the main test suite uses `node:test` |
| Python 3 | any | Only for the real-terminal end-to-end check |
| Docker | any | Only for testing Linux from a Mac |

```sh
git clone https://github.com/piyushy111/StackPilot.git && cd StackPilot
./setup.sh           # macOS, Linux, Windows WSL2   ·   Windows PowerShell: .\setup.ps1
```

`setup.sh` checks the tools above and installs Bun if needed (it asks first). It then installs the
dependencies (which installs a husky pre-commit hook: lint + type check) and links a `stackpilot` command to your
checkout, and it finishes by running lint, the type check and the test suites. `--check` only reports,
and `--yes` accepts every default.

**Windows:** StackPilot monitors and manages macOS and Linux processes, and its process tests use POSIX
process groups. So the full setup (running Kestrel and every test suite) happens in **WSL2**: run
`wsl --install`, clone the repository inside WSL, then `./setup.sh`. On a plain Windows checkout,
`setup.ps1` (or `setup.sh` in Git Bash) prepares the dependencies, hooks, lint and type check, which is
enough for docs and most UI and config work. CI runs the setup on Linux, macOS and Windows.

Then:

```sh
npm run demo         # the process manager on the demo stack
npm start            # the dashboard
```

[docs/DEV.md](docs/DEV.md) lists every command, the Linux-on-a-Mac loop and how performance is measured.

## Before you open a pull request

```sh
npm run lint          # Biome (lint only)
npm run typecheck     # tsc over the JSDoc types in core/ and cli/
npm test              # core + CLI under Node
npm run test:bun      # the same under Bun (on macOS this includes the native sampler checks)
npm run test:ui       # UI frame tests
sh scripts/e2e/pm-e2e.sh   # optional locally, required in CI: kestrel pm in a real terminal
```

CI runs what your change can affect (the rules are in `scripts/ci-changes.sh`):

| You changed | CI runs |
|---|---|
| Only docs (Markdown, `docs/`, issue templates) | Nothing but the "CI result" check, in seconds |
| Code | Lint, types, shellcheck, and the test suites plus the terminal E2E on Linux |
| Platform or process code (`core/platform`, `core/processManager`, `core/stack`, e2e scripts) | Also macOS, and Debian + Amazon Linux containers |
| `setup.sh`, `setup.ps1`, `.husky/`, `package.json`, `bun.lock` | Also the developer setup on Linux, macOS and Windows |
| Engine code (`core/`) | Also the CPU regression guard |
| Build tooling (`scripts/build.js`, `packaging/`) | Also the four standalone binaries |

Pushes to `main` also run macOS and build the binaries whenever code changed. "CI result" is the
single required check.

## How the code is organised

- `core/` is the engine (platform adapters, sampler, store, process manager, stack, config) and has no
  UI dependencies. The only way in is `createKestrel()` → `{ store, actions }`.
- `cli/` handles argument parsing and commands. `ui/` is the OpenTUI/React interface; it talks only to
  `store` and `actions`.
- `packaging/` and `scripts/` hold the installer, the npm launcher, builds, benchmarks and end-to-end
  tools.

## Rules the code follows

- **Tests first.** Parsers are tested against captured fixture output, so tests don't depend on the
  machine. Process behaviour is tested with real child processes (`scripts/fixture-server.js`).
- **The store and actions contract is frozen** (`core/store/types.js`, checked by
  `tests/unit/contract.test.js`). To change it, update BUILD_PLAN §6, the types and the contract test
  together.
- **Every action returns `{ ok, data, error, code }` and never throws.** Destructive actions go through
  the safety policy in the core, not only the UI.
- **Kestrel's own OS calls never use a shell** (`execFile` with argument arrays). Only commands from
  the user's stack config run through a shell.
- **Child output is untrusted:** the UI strips escape sequences before drawing it.
- **State updates are immutable.** Local, private buffers in hot paths are the documented exception.
- Files stay under 400 lines and functions under 50. Comments explain *why*, not what.
- **Performance is measured, not assumed.** Include before/after numbers from `scripts/bench.js`
  (engine, children included) or `scripts/bench-ui.jsx` (UI per frame) for anything on a hot path.
- The macOS native sampler (`core/platform/darwinFfi.js`) takes struct layouts from the SDK. After an
  SDK change, regenerate them with `scripts/darwin-offsets.c` rather than editing offsets by hand.

## Commits and pull requests

- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
  `feat(cli): …`, `fix(darwin): …`, `perf(linux): …`, `docs: …`, `test: …`, `ci: …`, `chore: …`.
  The body says *why*, and gives numbers for performance changes.
- Keep commits small and self-contained; each should pass the test suites on its own.
- Pull requests use the template: what changed, how it was tested, and whether docs or the contract
  changed.
- Releases are cut by maintainers from a tag; [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) has the steps.
- Changing the UI, `--help` or the version? Run `bun run website:generate` and commit `website/src/generated/`: the
  website shows real captures of the app, and CI checks they are current. See [website/README.md](website/README.md).
